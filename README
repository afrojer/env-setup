How to install / use:

1. git clone git://github.com/afrojer/env-setup.git ~/.env

2. ln -s ~/.env/bash_profile ~/.bashrc
   (depending on your system, you may want to make it .bash_profile)

3. add the following lines to "~/.env-setup":
   export ENV_ROOT=~/.env
   export ENV_ROOT_EXTRA=~/.bashrc.d

4. Now you can add files to ~/.bashrc.d and they will automagically
   get sourced into your environment at login.

Enjoy,
